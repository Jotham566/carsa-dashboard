## 🔄 Backend Model vs. Available APIs

### HiringFunnel Model Fields
The backend **has database fields** for:
- `candidates_interviewed` ✅ (field exists)
- `candidates_offered` ✅ (field exists)  
- `candidates_hired` ✅ (field exists)

**BUT no APIs to update these fields!** They're currently always 0.

### What This Means:
- The database is **ready** for these features
- The backend **models** support the full hiring funnel
- But the **API endpoints** haven't been implemented
- Frontend cannot use these features until APIs are added

---

## 📋 Recommended Approach

### Phase 1 (MVP) - Use What's Available
Focus on features with full backend support:
1. Job creation and management
2. CV upload and processing
3. AI evaluation and scoring
4. Shortlisting and ranking
5. Basic analytics

### Phase 2 - Request Backend Updates
Work with backend team to add:
1. API endpoints for updating candidate status
2. Interview tracking endpoints
3. Offer management APIs
4. Enhanced analytics endpoints

### Phase 3 - Full ATS Features
Once backend support is added:
1. Complete hiring funnel tracking
2. Interview scheduling
3. Offer management
4. Advanced analytics

## 🎯 Action Items for Frontend Development

### Do Implement (Backend Ready):
- ✅ Complete job workflow (create → upload JD → generate scorecard)
- ✅ Full candidate processing (upload → extract → evaluate)
- ✅ Ranking and shortlisting features
- ✅ Export and reporting capabilities
- ✅ Team collaboration on available features

### Don't Implement Yet (No Backend):
- ❌ Interview scheduling buttons/workflows
- ❌ "Mark as Hired" functionality
- ❌ Offer letter features
- ❌ Time-to-hire metrics (full cycle)
- ❌ Interview feedback forms

### Display with Disclaimers:
- Show funnel visualization but note "Interview & Hire tracking coming soon"
- Display analytics but focus on available metrics
- Include placeholder UI with "Coming in Phase 2" labels

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Available API Endpoints: 54+
- `/api/v1/auth/*` - 8 endpoints
- `/api/v1/jobs/*` - 12 endpoints
- `/api/v1/candidates/*` - 10 endpoints
- `/api/v1/evaluations/*` - 8 endpoints
- `/api/v1/rankings/*` - 6 endpoints
- `/api/v1/analytics/*` - 6 endpoints
- `/api/v1/organizations/*` - 4+ endpoints

### Missing API Endpoints (Needed for Full ATS):
- `PUT /api/v1/candidates/:id/status` - Update candidate status
- `POST /api/v1/interviews/*` - Interview management
- `POST /api/v1/offers/*` - Offer management
- `PUT /api/v1/analytics/funnel/:job_id` - Update funnel stages
- `POST /api/v1/notifications/*` - Email/notification system

## 📝 Recommendations

1. **Proceed with MVP** using available features
2. **Communicate clearly** about what's coming in future phases
3. **Design UI** to accommodate future features (but disable/hide them)
4. **Work with backend team** to prioritize missing APIs
5. **Focus on delivering value** with current capabilities

The current backend provides **strong foundation** for a powerful recruitment tool, even without full ATS capabilities. The MVP can deliver significant value in automating CV screening and evaluation.
